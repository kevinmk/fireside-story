      <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
      <p>The rain plinked softly on the tin roof of the house.</p>
      <p>With a crash of thunder, the power suddenly goes out!</p>
      <p>"It's dark!", yelled Sarah, "Is anybody th-there?"</p>
      <p>"Sarah pauses, waiting for an answer, then reaches out and takes a step in the darkness."</p>
